    <h2>Horror Fiction</h2>
    <p>
      Horror is a genre of speculative fiction which is intended to frighten, scare, or disgust. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon defined the horror story as "a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks, or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing". Horror intends to create an eerie and frightening atmosphere for the reader. Horror is often divided into the psychological horror and supernatural horror sub-genres.
      Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society.

    <h2>Horror Films</h2>
    <p>
      A horror film is one that seeks to elicit fear or disgust in its audience for entertainment purposes. Horror films additionally aim to evoke viewers' nightmares, revulsions and terror of the unknown or the macabre.
      Initially inspired by literature from authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror has existed as a film genre
      for more than a century. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction, and thriller genres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plots within the horror genre often involve the intrusion of an evil force, event, or personage into the everyday world, and may deal with transgressive topics or themes. Prevalent elements include death, the supernatural, cults, possession, monsters, religion and folklore, dystopian or apocalyptic worlds, mental disorders, gore and torture, cannibalism and serial killers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cinematic techniques used in horror films have been shown to provoke psychological reactions in an audience. From its origins in trick films and German Expressionism, many sub-genres of horror have emerged throughout its history,
      including body horror, comedy horror, folk horror, slasher films, supernatural horror and psychological horror.

    <h2>Ghoul</h2>
    <p>
      Ghoul (Arabic: غول‎, ghūl) is a demon-like being or monstrous humanoid originating in pre-Islamic Arabian religion, associated with graveyards and consuming human flesh. In modern fiction, the term has often been used for a certain kind of undead monster.
    </p>
    <p>
      By extension, the word ghoul is also used in a derogatory sense to refer to a person who delights in the macabre or
      whose profession is linked directly to death, such as a gravedigger or graverobber.
